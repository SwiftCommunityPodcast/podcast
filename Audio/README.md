# Audio source file links

This page contains links to the original audio source files used to make the Swift Community Podcast. It’s recommended to use GarageBand for editing, even though it’s not the most sophisticated tool — since it’s [free from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id682658836).
