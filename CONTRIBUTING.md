# Episode Contributing

Every episode requires contribution in the following areas

- pre-production
- production
- post-production
- publishing
- marketing
- follow up

Anyone is welcome to fill any and all roles and or build a team to fill each role for each episode. To begin work on an episode start by creating an Episode proposal using the template script. Once you create the proposal, open a pull request. Then garner support for your episode and start filling in any necessary roles.

## Pre-Production

We all love listening to podcasts, but before we hit the record button, there's a decent amount of work that goes into the podcast before you're ready to hit record. That work is called pre-production and it includes mostly episode topic ideation, reaching out to potential co-hosts/guests, and scheduling.

## Production

You've set the date to record your episode and today is the day! Whether the episode includes one person or more, someone should take the lead today as the lead-host. The lead host is responsible for doing the intro and outro and making sure the episode stays on track. Someone also needs to manage the recording process (We use TryCa.st) and that person can be the lead host as well or someone else.

## Post-Production

Congratulations! You’ve recorded your episode, now you need to edit and mix it to make it sound Shiny! As the leader of post-production you will need to download the raw file of each hosts audio track, import those files into an audio editor (GarageBand is free!), edit the tracks so everything matches up, mix them so they sound good, then export them into one file. You can even import that file into iTunes and edit the metadata.

## Publishing

The episode is Shiny and ready to be heard by the world, so now you need to publish it! Publishing includes uploading the file to our publisher, ensuring all the episode information, details, and metadata is correct, including the show notes. Once its all ready to go, hit publish.

## Marketing

Once the episode has been published, it would be helpful to spread the word about it and that’s where marketing comes in. If you take on the marketing role, you’ll need to share the episode link on twitter, tagging the appropriate handles.

## Follow up

Once an episode is out in the wild, a lot of people will respond with questions, comments, and feedback, and its important that we respond to them. As the person in charge of follow up, you will need to stay tuned to the response to the episode in the days following its launch and ensure that we engage with the community.
